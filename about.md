Hi, I'm Rachel Davies. I've been working in software development since 1987 although I haven't done much serious coding in the last few years.

I wrote a book about ["Agile Coaching"](https://pragprog.com/book/sdcoach/agile-coaching) with [Liz Sedley](https://pragprog.com/users/display_profile/48266). I currently work as an Agile Coach at [Unruly](http://open.unruly.co/). I'm often invited to speak at [industry events](http://lanyrd.com/profile/rachelcdavies/). 

I've been blogging since 2004 and recently pulled most of my old posts over here from
 [agilecoach.typepad.com](http://agilecoach.typepad.com).
