I'm Rachel Davies and I've been working in software development since 1987. I wrote a basic book about ["Agile Coaching"](https://pragprog.com/book/sdcoach/agile-coaching) with [Liz Sedley](https://pragprog.com/users/display_profile/48266). I like eXtreme Programming (XP). In my spare time I like going for long walks.
