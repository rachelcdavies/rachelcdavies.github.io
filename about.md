Hi, I'm Rachel Davies. I've been working in software development since 1987 (although I haven't done much serious coding in the last few years). I wrote a basic book about ["Agile Coaching"](https://pragprog.com/book/sdcoach/agile-coaching) with [Liz Sedley](https://pragprog.com/users/display_profile/48266). Nowadays I coach XP teams at [Unruly](http://tech.unruly.co/) in London.
I've been blogging since 2004 and recently pulled most of my old posts over here.
