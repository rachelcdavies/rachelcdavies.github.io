I'm Rachel Davies and I've been applying eXtreme Programming (XP) since 2000. 

My current role is Lead Engineer at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). Prior to that I worked with as a Team Lead at [Unruly](https://unruly.github.io/). I've also written book on [Agile Coaching](https://pragprog.com/book/sdcoach/agile-coaching) with [Liz Sedley](https://pragprog.com/users/display_profile/48266).  


In my spare time I like going for long walks and playing in the [LSO Community Gamelan group](https://lso.co.uk/lso-discovery/community/community-gamelan-group.html).
