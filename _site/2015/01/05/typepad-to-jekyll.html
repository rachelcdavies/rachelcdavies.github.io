    <h1 class="post-title">Moving from Typepad to Jekyll</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">05 Jan 2015</p>

  <article class="post-content"><p>I recently migrated this website from Typepad to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Here are some of the reasons why and some tips on getting started with Jekyll.</p>

<p>My main reason for moving away from Typepad is to simplify the layout of my blog. I’m no longer in the consulting game and also wish to retire my ancient website – thrown together in PHP one rainy Sunday more than 10 years ago! Nowadays, I’d like a simple website around my blog with as little hassle required polishing posts. When both these moves are complete, I’ll also save a few pennies on hosting costs.</p>

<p>My usual pattern is to write my blog posts as plain text files while I’m offline on the train to London. I was used to pushing these into Typepad when I  eventually got online. One of the fiddly bits in moving from a plain text draft was positioning photos with related text using Typepad platform. I was attracted to Jekyll as it enables me to edit pages on my laptop using a basic text editor and check what they look like by running locally before pushing them to <a href="https://github.com/rachelcdavies">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I already had a GitHub account so getting started with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> was straightforward. Next I downloaded <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which has plenty of helpful documentation. I exported my posts from Typepad and ran <a href="https://github.com/dams/typepad_to_jekyll">typepad_to_jekyll</a>. Now running locally, I could see that everything I’d written since 2004 was safely over!</p>

<p>I did a bit of tinkering with layout after reading some tips from <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/">Joshua Lande</a>. I decided not to enable comments as I’d like to move discussion over to <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelcdavies">Twitter</a> so I’ve implemented his Twitter plug on my blog posts.</p>

<p>I also wanted an <a href="http://rachelcdavies.github.io/events/">Events</a> page generated from simple markdown files listing name and link of event and was very happy how quick this was to put together. See snippet below.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">{% for event in site.events %}
  {{ event.date | date: ' %d %b %Y '}} <span class="ni">&amp;raquo;</span> [{{ event.title }}]({{ event.link }})
{% endfor %}</code></pre></figure>

<p>My new site is still work-in-progress, many photos embedded in old posts link to images on Typepad – I’ll be gradually trawling through to clean those up. The site also has rather a vanilla look to it for now. But I’m happy with my new site and definitely have a smoother workflow for new posts. Please alert me to any glitches you spot with it.</p>
