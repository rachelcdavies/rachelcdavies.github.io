<p>At Unruly, I work with developers who use XP practices every day, it&#39;s the way we work and not a novelty.&#0160;When you&#39;ve spent years honing your <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Test-driven development">TDD</a> and <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Code refactoring">Refactoring</a> skills, you want to talk about other more advanced topics. Programming languages evolve and new frameworks emerge but meetups that are focussed on a language community often don&#39;t make concerns around TDD a core theme.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://agilecoach.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ee21bf2883401a5116d479b970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="DevelopersUnruly" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e54ee21bf2883401a5116d479b970c img-responsive" src="http://agilecoach.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ee21bf2883401a5116d479b970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="DevelopersUnruly" /></a></p>
<p>Our team are generalists and each developer works across the full stack front-end through to databases. We already run in-house lightning talks for developers who work here and in our co-working Hive space.&#0160;So we came up with the idea of hosting a new meetup specifically for programmers who are already using XP practices and have interesting experiences or insights to share.</p>
<p>To whet your appetite, here are some topics that our developers have given internal tech talks on in the last year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intern versus Dalek</li>
<li>load testing with Gatling</li>
<li>ClojureScript</li>
<li>Postgres foreign data wrappers</li>
<li>Dynamically tracing java applications with BTtrace</li>
<li>Types vs Tests</li>
<li>Promises and Futures</li>
<li>Vert.x</li>
<li>AOP in Guice</li>
<li>Cage Fight: Puppet vs Salt Stack</li>
<li>MongoDB aggregation framework</li>
<li>ElasticSearch</li>
<li>Riak</li>
<li>Cascalog</li>
<li>Java 8 lambdas</li>
<li>R and GGPlot</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#39;ve got a great space at <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.unrulymedia.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Unruly">Unruly Media</a> in our Clubhouse (see pic)&#0160;and as we&#39;re located just off Brick Lane we thought it might be nice to provide some spicy snacks! We&#39;re not attempting to compete with existing meetups like <a href="xpday-london.editme.com/eXtremeTuesdayClub" target="_blank" title="Extreme Tuesday Club">Extreme Tuesday Club</a> or <a href="http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/" target="_blank" title="London Software Craftsmanship">London Software Craftsmanship</a>. So we&#39;ll be meeting up once a month on Monday evening (to avoid clashes) starting on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Extreme-Programmers-London/events/166297392/" target="_blank" title="XP London meetup">24th Feb</a>.&#0160;</p>

<p>Join us to explore how <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Extreme programming">extreme programming</a> is evolving and ideas relevant to software craft looking beyond basic old-school XP/Agile practices (TDD, CI/CD, Refactoring, Pairing). We&#39;ve included some basic questions before we aprove membership to help ensure that members have some relevant development experience. Hope to see you at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Extreme-Programmers-London/" target="_blank" title="Extreme Programmers London Meet-up">Extreme Programmers London</a> soon!</p>
