title: Kickstart Your Retrospective with Continuous Timeline

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Sometimes retrospectives can be slow to get going as team members rack their brains trying to remember events over the last couple of weeks. A simple solution to this can be for the team to maintain a &quot;continuous timeline&quot; which can be used to kickstart conversations in retrospectives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Here&#39;s how we do this at <a href="http://www.unrulymedia.com/" target="_blank">Unruly</a>. We record any significant events on our team whiteboard at standup time or during the day. When it comes to the retrospective, we take a photo and bring print- outs that we can refer to. We also email a copy of the board photo to Aimy, one of our product managers based in our New York office so she can see what the team in London are talking about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I&#39;ve included a photos from each team below. When Arber, one of our product managers in London, originally skteched these on the board he chose engaging templates for each team: a Monopoly board and a Snakes &amp; Ladders board which helps keep this activity informal and lighthearted. We log any significant incidents and events -- especially if they become a time-suck live issues -- along with social stuff like team lunches and cakes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Yesterday I met Chris who has a similar practice at a large investment bank albeit slightly less visual. His team write a daily team log on a wiki page and then refer to the entries over the last two weeks in their retrospectives. I&#39;d be interested to hear if any other teams have a similar practice.</span></p>
