I signed up for this trek to help raise funds for <a title="Alzheimers Society" href="http://alzheimers.org.uk" target="_blank">Alzheimer's Society</a>  - a membership organisation, which works to improve the quality of life of people affected by dementia in UK. They provide services such as day care and home care for people with dementia, as well as support and befriending services to help partners and families cope with the demands of caring.  <br /><br />Even though it's a long way, I'm looking forward to the walk across <a class="zem_slink" title="Salisbury Plain" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Plain" target="_blank">Salisbury Plain</a> starting at the world famous Stonehenge as the sun rises above the ancient stones and finishing at the pretty village of Avebury, partially encompassed by the stone circle of standing stones. Our itinerary also takes in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Pewsey" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pewsey" target="_blank">Pewsey White Horse</a> etched into the chalk hillside and <a class="zem_slink" title="Silbury Hill" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silbury_Hill" target="_blank">Silbury Hill</a>. <br /><br />I am optimistic that I will complete this walk as I regularly enjoy walking 16 miles at weekends with <a title="Rugby Ramblers" href="rugbyramblers.org.uk" target="_blank">Rugby Ramblers</a> and knowing this walk will raise funds to help carers will give me energy to walk the extra miles.<br /><br />A big thank you to all my friends for sponsoring me. I also discovered that <a title="Unruly Media" href="http://www.unrulymedia.com/" target="_blank">Unruly</a> have a brilliant policy for encouraging our team to get involved in charity by generously matching funds raised. This news means any money that you can spare to sponsor me gets doubled!
