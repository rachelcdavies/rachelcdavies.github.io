title: Introducing Agile Techniques to Teams Outside Software Development

<p>Recently I&#39;ve been helping teams outside Development apply some basic Agile practices. Our company was founded using XP at the core of our approach to software development. We&#39;ve grown along with the success of our products and now have several departments with day-to-day work that does not involve the Development team (such as Finance, Infrastructure, and &quot;People &amp; Places&quot; who combine HR and facilities management) interested in managing their work along similar lines.</p>
<p>

We start with a simple sketch about how to make the work for the week visible on the wall then put it together using super-sticky notes - see the photo from our Infra team based. Columns can be added as needed and, when the system seems to be working, lines can be added with tape. Our People &amp; Places team brought in a spirit level and some flowery scrapbooking tape for to make their wall beautiful.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://agilecoach.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ee21bf28834017d3bd42cde970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="InfraBoard" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e54ee21bf28834017d3bd42cde970c" src="http://agilecoach.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ee21bf28834017d3bd42cde970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="InfraBoard" /></a>Around the board, we run a simple meeting cycle: surfacing and prioritising work for the week ahead, daily standups and monthly retrospectives. People on these teams are positive about the new approach because it helps them to know what&#39;s going on around them and have the benefit of advice from team members. They&#39;re also enjoying spending more time together as a team and getting a buzz from seeing how much work has been Done. Our People &amp; Places team even have a large photo album where they file all their Done tickets so they&#39;ll be able to look back later. </p>
<p>Challenges that come up are pretty typical things we see in software development teams, like long standups and large tasks that don&#39;t move. We don&#39;t currently estimate the work or apply work-in-progress limits although we&#39;ve discussed whether this might be worth experimenting with. For now we&#39;re limited by wall space and when columns get too full we can see we&#39;re being a little optimistic -- taking on too much work or have a lot depending on external suppliers.</p>
<p>Based on this experience I convened an <a href="http://agile2012.agilealliance.org/program/open-jam-stage/" target="_blank" title="Open Jam">Open Jam</a> discussion at Agile2012 for people who were also interested in applying Agile techniques with non-software teams at Agile. You can see the original flipchart notes <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42514466@N08/sets/72157631052237990/" target="_blank" title="photos of flipchart notes">here</a>.&#0160; I&#39;ve reworded them a little to help the points discussed clearer.</p>
<h3>What&#39;s different outside software development?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not having a shared goal (on the org chart but not sharing work as a team)</li>
<li>IT based examples may not help communicate ideas to non-software people</li>
<li>Work may be very fluid or constrained by lead times and dependencies on other groups</li>
<li>Team members may be used to being told what to do</li>
<li> Team members may be uncomfortable with increased visibility of their work</li>
<li>Team may have more varied experience levels whereas in software development most are engineering graduates</li>
<li>Individuals may not be interested in team goals if they have a strong focus on their own objectives</li>
</ul>
<h3>What techniques are not specific to sw dev that you can try anywhere?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visible work &quot;Kanban&quot;</li>
<li>Standup meetings</li>
<li>Setting priorities as a team</li>

<li>Product Owner role (responsible for priorities)</li>

<li>Reviews / Showcases of work done</li>
<li>Timeboxing / Pomodoros (http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/)</li>
<li>Pairing</li>
<li>Test driving without automation</li>
<li>Visible outcomes - iterating over visible product</li>
<li>User stories: Who? What? Why?</li>
<li>Frequent user testing</li>
<li>Interactive facilitated workshops</li>
<li>Shorter more focussed meetings with only relevant people</li>

<p>If you came to this Agile2012 Open Jam session, please let me know if I&#39;ve missed anything important from this write-up. It would also be great to hear from anyone who has tried applying Agile techniques outside software, what challenges did you encounter and how did you overcome them?</p>
