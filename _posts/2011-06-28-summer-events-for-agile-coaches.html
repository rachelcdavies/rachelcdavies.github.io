<p>Summer is here at last with blasts of rain and sunshine. Here some upcoming events that might be of interest to you as agile coaches in the UK.</p>
<p><a href="http://agilecoach.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ee21bf28834014e89739a28970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Cloud" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e54ee21bf28834014e89739a28970d" src="http://agilecoach.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ee21bf28834014e89739a28970d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Cloud" /></a> <br />The first one that I&#39;d like to bring to your attention is the <a href="http://www.agilecoachesgathering.org/" target="_blank" title="Agile Coaches Gathering">Agile Coaches Gathering</a> at historic <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Bletchley Park">Bletchley Park</a>. This event is put together by volunteers (yours truly and Manav Mehan). The event starts on Friday with an Open Space gathering to create a lively program of conversations and simulations relevant to agile coaches. In the evening we venture into Bletchley for dinner at the local chinese and indian restaurants and beers in the pub. The sessions run throughout the day on Saturday. The past two years we&#39;ve had sunny weather and many sessions outside on the lawn. As I write, we already have 40 people registered for the event and just 20 places left, sign up <a href="http://acg2011.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank" title="Register here">here</a> to get yours.</p>
<p>&#0160; <a href="http://agilecoach.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ee21bf28834014e89737ee4970d-pi" style="float: right;"> </a><br /> <a href="http://agilecoach.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ee21bf2883401538f802287970b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Sdcoach_small" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e54ee21bf2883401538f802287970b" src="http://agilecoach.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ee21bf2883401538f802287970b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Sdcoach_small" /></a> I&#39;m also excited to announce that I&#39;ll be running my <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/agile-scrum/agile-coaching-skills" target="_blank" title="Agile Coaching Skills">Agile Coaching Skills</a> training course in London on 25-26th August. This workshop style class has been extremely popular, past attendees include <a href="http://jonjagger.blogspot.com/" target="_self" title="Jon Jagger">Jon Jagger</a> and <a href="http://www.jime.co.uk/blog/agile-coaching-skills-course" target="_blank" title="John McFadyen">John McFadyen</a>. Unlike a Certified Scrum Master class, we assume that you have some agile experience and our focus is on skills that you need to coach agile teams, such as the art of facilitation and System Thinking.</p>
