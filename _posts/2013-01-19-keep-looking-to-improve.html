<p>I have to admit that I don&#39;t follow Football news. However, <a href="http://thescore.thejournal.ie/nigel-adkins-message-760839-Jan2013/" target="_blank" title="Nigel Atkins news">this story</a> caught my eye. When Nigel Atkins was terminated as manager at Southampton, he lefthis players with a positive message on the dressing-room wall before he cleared out his office.</p>
<p><img alt="Atkins" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e54ee21bf28834017ee7a6111d970d" src="http://agilecoach.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54ee21bf28834017ee7a6111d970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Atkins" /></p>
<p>These nuggets of advice could be used by agile coaches too! I particularly like &quot;Keep Looking to Improve&quot; as it encourages us to keep our eyes and minds open to doing better than we are now. While at the same time having confidence in our ability to do the right thing.</p>
