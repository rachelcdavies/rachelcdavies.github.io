title: Home Truths about Distributed Agile

<p>Today I tweeted <em>&quot;Most Distributed Agile efforts make a travesty of original Agile values &amp; render many agile practices pointless.&quot;</em> This may sound like a case of sour grapes but I don&#39;t mean to sound like a cynical commentator talking from the sidelines. I&#39;m pretty sad about this situation and wish it wasn&#39;t so. However, I think more people need to speak out about the problems with trying to apply Agile in a distributed setting so organisations go into this with their eyes open.<br /><br />My main motivation in coaching agile teams is to help them apply agile  principles and practices effectively. I hate to see people&#39;s time wasted in pointless activities, that includes me, as well as the teams I coach. More often nowadays I find myself working with people who want to use an Agile approach in the context of a large organisation, where people working on a project are spread over multiple locations. Time again I find myself questioning whether it is possible to get the benefits offered by an Agile approach in this situation.<br /><br />At the heart of Agile software development are some basic ideas.<br /><br />* better alignment with business priorities by working directly with business throughout the project to create a value stream rather than one big delivery at the end<br />* improved accountability through transparent progress against visible plans<br />* building software that is fit for purpose by proactively seeking user feedback<br />* improved understanding through conversation rather than reliance on documentation<br />* reduced management overhead as self-organising team determines daily work<br /><br />Advantages of a collocated team:<br />* can easily have conversations where everyone is included, decisions can be made quickly.<br />* can use low-tech tools to supplement conversations, such as whiteboards, sticky notes, index cards.<br />* can see who&#39;s in the office and whether they&#39;re busy.<br />* can socialise to build better relationships improving collaboration within and outside team.<br /><br />Contrast this with a distributed group:<br />* more formality required for meetings, narrow windows when everyone is available and heavy reliance on teleconferences without visualisations<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />* Working as a team enables individuals to self-organise around the work<br />* Reducing the barriers between team members allows them to communicate more quickly.<br />* Decisions can be made more quickly when teams are together<br />* Transparency to business is better<br /><br /></p>
